# Budget-Tracker

AS AN avid traveller, I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

# How It Works

* Enter the name and the amount of a transaction.

* Click on either "Add funds" to add to the total amount or click on "Subtract Funds" to take out the total amount.
